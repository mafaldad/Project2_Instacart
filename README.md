Instacart is a grocery delivery platform where customers can register an order and have it delivered, similar to Uber Eats and Door Dash.
This particular data set was publicly released by Instacart in 2017 for a Kaggle competition. The objective  of this project is to clean the data and prepare a report that provides insights into the shopping habits of Instacart customers.

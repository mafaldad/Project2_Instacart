# Instacart Consumer Behavior Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Overview:**

This project involves an in-depth analysis of consumer behavior patterns using data from Instacart. The goal is to understand customer ordering habits, product preferences, and temporal trends by analyzing five datasets related to orders, products, aisles, departments, and order details. Various data preprocessing steps were applied to ensure data quality, followed by visualization and analysis using Python libraries.

**Key Skills & Concepts:**

* Data Loading and Inspection: Read and inspected five data frames (orders, products, aisles, departments, order_products) to understand data structure, types, and completeness.
* Data Preprocessing: Corrected data types, handled missing and duplicate values, and ensured dataset integrity.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Applied filters and grouping techniques to discover patterns in ordering behavior, product popularity, and reordering trends.
* Data Visualization: Created visualizations using Matplotlib to showcase ordering patterns across time, product preferences, and customer behavior.

**Key Insights:** 

* Most orders are placed between 10 am and 4 pm, peaking on Sundays and Mondays.
* Customers tend to reorder after approximately seven days, with notable spikes on days 7, 15, and 21.
* Bananas are the most frequently ordered and reordered product, and the top 20 reordered items are primarily fruits and vegetables.
* Organic products are highly preferred by customers, with 15 of the top 20 most ordered products being organic.
* Customers typically add 4-6 items per order, with bananas being the first item placed in the cart in many orders.

**Tools Used:**
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib): Data manipulation, filtering, and visualization.
